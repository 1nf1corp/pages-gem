# GitHub Pages Ruby Gem

A simple gem to bootstrap dependencies for setting up and maintaining a local Jekyll environment in sync with GitHub Pages.

## Usage

Run the following command:

`gem install github-pages`

Alternatively, you can add the following to your project's Gemfile:

`gem 'github-pages'`

*Note: You are not required to install Jekyll separately. Once the `github-pages` gem is installed, you can build your site using `jekyll build`, or preview your site using `jekyll serve`.*

## Building

To build a new version of the gem, run `script/build`
